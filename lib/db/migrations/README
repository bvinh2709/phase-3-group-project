# Phase 3 Project

🎉🎉🎉 Welcome! 🎉🎉🎉

For our project, we created a tool for shipping services to use. Our product will help those services to link restaurants and their suppliers with the necessary deliveries.

Users can input restaurants, suppliers and the carriers needed to make deliveries. A user can also input the inventories of each restaurant and supplier they add. Finally, all this information can be recalled by the program for the user to review. 

User instructions:
